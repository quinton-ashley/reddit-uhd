# Redesign Philosophy and Goals
The purpose of the redesign is to load full quality images on the front page of reddit and for all subreddits, not tiny thumbnails or annoying collapsible preview images.  My end goal is to make desktop reddit look more modern on high-res screens and less ugly, like a big screen version of the beautiful iOS reddit app.  This app requires a fast internet connection for the best experience as it will load full images.
