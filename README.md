## Redesign Philosophy and Goals
[reddit-uhd](https://github.com/quinton-ashley/reddit-uhd) replaces tiny thumbnails and annoying collapsible preview images with full quality images, gifs, and videos on the front page of reddit and for all subreddits.  Transforms the design of every page, making reddit modern, clutter-free, and dark with an intuitive layout.  This extension is a must have for those that frequent photography subreddits and anyone who wants a truly enhanced browsing experience on reddit.  If you like this extension, consider showing your appreciation for the time, love, and effort I put in by making a one time donation to my Paypal.

## REQUIRED PREFERENCE
Don't allow subreddits to show you custom themes!

## Recommended Preferences
For the best experience use these Preferences on your reddit account:
Don't autoplay videos on the desktop comments page
Don't beta test features

## RES Coexistence
This extension can coexist with the Reddit Enhancement Suite extension.  I don't personally recommend using the RES extension but if you want to use it I recommend switching on No Popups (core) and night mode (appearance).  Switch off User Info (user), Subreddit Manager (subreddits), and Multireddit Navigation (subreddits).

## Know Issues
When used with RES, the "My Subreddits" dropdown menu doesn't appear.  If you know why please help me out!

## Feature Requests
Please make feature requests on the project's Github [issues page](https://github.com/quinton-ashley/reddit-uhd/issues).

## Regarding Ads
This extension does not and will never remove native ads on reddit.  I have very puposefully preserved reddit's ads while developing this extension.  Reddit is supported by ads and native ads are not obtrusive or obnoxious.  My goal is to increase the popularity of reddit, not hurt the site's profitability.
