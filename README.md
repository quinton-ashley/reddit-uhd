## Redesign Philosophy and Goals

[reddit-uhd](https://github.com/quinton-ashley/reddit-uhd) replaces tiny thumbnails and annoying collapsible preview images with full quality images, gifs, and videos on the front page of reddit and for all subreddits.

This extension transforms the design of every page, making reddit modern and clutter-free. This extension is a must have for those that frequent photography subreddits or just for anyone who wants a truly enhanced browsing experience on reddit.

If you appreciate this extension please make a one time donation with [Paypal](https://www.paypal.me/qashto/5).

## REQUIRED PREFERENCE

Don't allow subreddits to show you custom themes!

## Recommended Preferences

For the best experience use these Preferences on your reddit account:
Don't autoplay videos on the desktop comments page
Don't beta test features

## RES Coexistence

This extension can coexist with the Reddit Enhancement Suite extension. I don't personally recommend using the RES extension but if you want to use it I recommend switching on No Popups (core) and night mode (appearance). Switch off User Info (user), Subreddit Manager (subreddits), and Multireddit Navigation (subreddits).

Except, when used with RES the "My Subreddits" dropdown menu doesn't appear. If you can understand why please help me out!

## Feature Requests

Please make feature requests on the project's Github [issues page](https://github.com/quinton-ashley/reddit-uhd/issues).
