### Install

[chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/reddit-uhd/lbgicmachmkfbkbldccboimfplmemfip?hl=en-US)  
[firefox addon](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/reddit-uhd/)  
[userscript](https://github.com/quinton-ashley/reddit-uhd/raw/master/js/qashto_reddit-uhd.user.js)

### Redesign Philosophy and Goals

[reddit-uhd](https://github.com/quinton-ashley/reddit-uhd) replaces tiny thumbnails and annoying collapsible preview images with full quality images, gifs, and videos on the front page of reddit and for all subreddits.  Transforms the design of every page, making reddit modern, clutter-free, and dark with an intuitive layout.  This extension is a must have for those that frequent photography subreddits and anyone who wants a truly enhanced browsing experience on reddit.  I made this extension in my free time.  If you appreciate this extension please make a one time donation with [Paypal](https://www.paypal.me/qashto/5).  If you want to support the continued development of reddit-uhd, consider making a monthly donation to my [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/qashto).  If you don't have the money to donate, please share reddit-uhd with your friends and post about it on your favorite subreddits.  Enjoy the definitive reddit experience! :)

### REQUIRED PREFERENCE

Don't allow subreddits to show you custom themes!

### Recommended Preferences

For the best experience use these Preferences on your reddit account:
Don't autoplay videos on the desktop comments page
Don't beta test features

### RES Coexistence

This extension can coexist with the Reddit Enhancement Suite extension.  I don't personally recommend using the RES extension but if you want to use it I recommend switching on No Popups (core) and night mode (appearance).  Switch off User Info (user), Subreddit Manager (subreddits), and Multireddit Navigation (subreddits).

### Know Issues

When used with RES, the "My Subreddits" dropdown menu doesn't appear.  If you know why please help me out!

### Feature Requests

Please make feature requests on the project's Github [issues page](https://github.com/quinton-ashley/reddit-uhd/issues).

### Regarding Ads

This extension does not and will never remove native ads on reddit.  I have very purposefully preserved reddit's ads while developing this extension.  Reddit is supported by ads and native ads are not obtrusive or obnoxious.  My goal is to increase the popularity of reddit, not hurt the site's profitability.
